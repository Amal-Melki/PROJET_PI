Placeholder file for the images directory.

In a production application, this directory would contain real images for each event space, such as:
- conference_room.jpg
- garden_event.jpg
- meeting_room.jpg
- lounge.jpg
- etc.

For now, our application will use external placeholder images from public URLs.
