This is a placeholder file. Replace this with an actual default.jpg image file.

In a real application, this would be a proper image file, but for demonstration purposes, we're using this placeholder.

When an admin adds a new space without selecting a photo, or when a photo fails to load, the system will attempt to use this file as a fallback.
